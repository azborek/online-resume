    <h2>Community Involvement and Philanthropy</h2>
    <p>
        I am committed to giving back to my community through both service and fundraising
        initiatives. My most notable philanthropic effort was competing as an Ironman
        Foundation Athlete in the Rockford 70.3 Half Ironman.
    </p>

    <p>
        As part of this effort, I raised funds to support local charitable organizations
        while completing the endurance demands of a half Ironman triathlon. This experience
        required months of disciplined training, goal setting, and perseverance, while
        aligning athletic achievement with meaningful community impact.
    </p>

    <p>
        Participating as an Ironman Foundation Athlete allowed me to combine personal growth
        with charitable advocacy, reinforcing my belief in service, accountability, and
        long term commitment to causes that positively affect local communities.
